A DPS mainly consists of a position measurement system, control system, thrust allocation (TA) system and propulsion system. It is known that vessels/platforms equipped with a DPS use thrusters and main propellers to produce a desired thrust via azimuth/tunnel thrusters, as well as to control maneuvering. Thrust can compensate for environmental forces acting on the vessel/platform to maintain position and head as closely as required to some desired position in the horizontal plane. DPS has also become one of key technologies for Marine Autonomous Surface System. This Special Issue will focus on recent developments in marine dynamic positioning system. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:\n Advanced control strategy for DPS; Thrust allocation method for DPS; Low-level thruster controller for DPS; Hydrodynamic performance analysis method for DPS; Cooperative control for DPS; Hybrid control for DPS; Decision making strategy for DP vessels; Case studies.

With this integrated system, autonomous ships are capable of following the predefined path, while avoiding the obstacles automatically. It is different from the methods in most published papers, which usually study path-following and obstacle collision avoidance, separately. This paper considers the coupled path following and collision avoidance task as a whole. Meanwhile, the paper also shows the heading control design method in the presence of static obstacles. To obtain a strong stability property, a nonlinear autopilot is designed based on the manoeuvring tests of the free-running ship model. The equilibrium point of the controller is globally exponentially stable. For the guidance system, a novel vector field method was proposed, and the proof shows the coupled guidance and control system is uniform semi-global exponentially stable (USGES). To prevent the obstacles near the predefined path, the proposed guidance law is augmented by integrating the repelling field of obstacles so that it can control the ship travel toward the predefined path through the obstacles safely. The repelling field function is given considering the obstacle shape and collision risk using the velocity obstacle (VO) algorithm.

The maritime industry is currently experiencing a disruptive change in technology through the increased development of advanced autonomy technologies leading to Maritime Autonomous Surface Ships (MASS), Unmanned Surface Vessels(USVs), Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs), underwater gliders, just to name a few. Automated vessel technology is rapidly transiting from the theoretical to the practical applications as the number and scope of unmanned vessels or autonomous ship projects increase around the globe. They have been widely used both in navy applications and even some commercial applications such as marine survey, coast patrol, inspection and operation of underwater production system. The most important reasons for the rapid development of autonomous vessels are safety concerns and economic benefit. Maritime accidents cause the loss of human lives, damage to the environment, and loss in the economy. The development towards autonomous marine ships will improve the situation greatly and are expected to become a cost-efficient alternative to conventional ships, improving the safety and environmental impact at sea. The main goal of this special issue is to address the key challenges, thereby promoting research on marine autonomous ships.

The path-planning algorithm is based in the angle-guidance fast marching square method and the path-following is based in the line-of-sight tracking algorithm. In order to validate the path-planning algorithm, numerical simulations were carried out to search the optimal path in a static environment of 50x20 m2 of area including various obstacles. The path-following algorithm was tested with an autonomous surface vehicle tracking a pre-established trajectory including static obstacles. The autonomous surface vehicle is a self-running scaled ship model of 2.5 m equipped with motions sensors, positioning GPS, propulsion DC motors, wi-fi shore communication. From the experiments and numerical simulation a good agreement was found.","tags":[],"title":"Path-planning and path-following control system for autonomous surface vessel","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Haitong Xu","C.

A PID heading autopilot controller is developed based on the 2nd Nomoto’s model and the parameters of the model are identified using the least square support vector machine. The Diagram of Vyshnegradsky is used to derive the parameters of the controller. In order to minimize the cross-track errors and heading errors, a path generation is introduced to generate a smooth curved path based on a piecewise cubic Hermite interpolation. A vector field algorithm is used to guide the autonomous surface vehicles to follow the smooth path. The simulation tests are carried out and the results are compared with the traditional line of sight method. The vector filed guidance law can guide the vehicles to follow the predefined the smoothed path with a small cross track error and heading errors with minimum control efforts. The vector field is a practical and robust method for autonomous surface vehicles guidance.","tags":[],"title":"Waypointfollowing for a marine surface ship model based on vector field guidance law","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gaspar Jose","Kamarlouei Mojtaba","Sinha Ashank","Haitong Xu","Calvario Miguel","Fay Francois-Xavier","Robles Eider","C.

This is achieved by controlling their rotational speed when the oil-hydraulic power fluctuates in time. Three speed control strategies have been presented, the first fixing the maximum possible speed in each sea state, the second by slowly varying the pump speed between speed peak values and average ones, and the third by working with highly variable speed reference values. The worst pump efficiency is achieved with the first strategy while the best one with the third strategy. However, the first has less impact than the third one in the pump lifecycle. On the other hand, the second strategy is used to make a trade-off between pump efficiency and lifecycle. However, this paper presents a fourth speed control strategy, which is a hybrid of the second and third strategies. So, the objectives of this paper were to know if these strategies are implementable in a test rig and also on a new PTO concept and determining what modifications should be introduced in these PTO strategies and hardware. This paper also contributes with the application of new methodologies in this field of research for the modelling of pump efficiency and pressure control, such as Neuro-Fuzzy modelling and Fuzzy Logic control systems.","tags":[],"title":"Speed control of oil-hydraulic power take-off system for oscillating body type wave energy converters","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Haitong Xu","C.
