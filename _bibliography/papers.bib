	abstract = {A L1 adaptive backstepping controller is proposed for path-following control of an underactuated ship based on a nonlinear steering model, and the control law is derived using Lypunov control function. L1 adaptive controller is a novel technology considering both the robustness and fast adaptation. The closed-loop control system is proved to be uniformly global asymptotically stable. A novel guidance law, time-varying vector field, is proposed for the guidance system. The kinematic analysis of path-following shows that the guidance and control systems are coupled, and the guidance system is affected by the performance of the controller. The Lyapunov method is employed to show that the equilibrium point of the whole system is uniformly global asymptotically stable.

	abstract = {The rolling motion behaviour of a composite trimaran was studied in the Jiangsu University of Science and Technology Ship hydrodynamic Centre. Series of the free roll decay tests were carried out in the seakeeping tank. The mathematical model of rolling motion mode is established considering both linear and nonlinear ship motion. The overall seakeeping behaviour of the vessel is discussed and particular attention is paid to the roll motion. The results of time-domain nonlinear hydrodynamic identification using ε-Support Vector Regression are validated against the model tests. The error of ε-Support Vector Regression is discussed and the relative error is less than 3%. The results suggest that the ε-Support Vector Regression is a reliable method for identification of the roll motion owning to its inherent benefits. Parametric roll is discussed and test results are presented. The nonlinear effect on the roll motions of the draft, spacing and attitude of side hulls is evaluated. The paper ends with a discussion on configurations of side hull for composite trimaran vessels. This paper can provide technical support in the optimization design of composite trimaran and the research of composite multi-hull ship.},

The dynamic Line of Sight approach is used to regulate the rudder angle and guide the Esso Osaka ship along the desired path. Gains are optimised using a genetic algorithm and a comprehensive cost function. The analysis covers a range of wave attack directions and sea states to evaluate the controller performance. Results demonstrate effective convergence to the desired path, although a steady-state error persists. Heading and rudder angle performance analyses show successful convergence and dynamic adjustments of the rudder angle to compensate for deviations. The findings underscore the influence of wave and wind conditions on ship performance and highlight the need for precise gain tuning.

	abstract = {To improve transportation efficiency, an adaptive speed control method is proposed for ship formation control when a ship formation enters a port with tidal elevation variations. The nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) method and leader‒follower structure are utilised for the formation keeping and trajectory tracking tasks. The proposed method establishes a ship manoeuvring model and a dynamic speed constraint model for adaptive speed control. A safe distance model is constructed to maintain a safe distance between ship formation members. The proposed safe distance model utilises a Serret‒Frenet (S‒F) coordinate system to describe the positions of ship formation members. Simulation experiments are applied to the North Channel of the Yangtze River. The experimental results indicate that the maximum actual draught accounts for 101.4% of the maximum safe draught without speed constraints. The draft ratio decreases to 99.2% after the adaptive speed control method is applied. This method can be utilised to effectively control ship formation navigation considering variations in tidal elevation. © 2025 The Author(s).

	abstract = {This paper introduces a decentralized control strategy for a heterogeneous team consisting of an unmanned surface vessel serving as the leader vehicle and two unmanned underwater vessels acting as follower vehicles. The team is designed to work together to accomplish underwater exploration missions. The communication network of the team is a fixed, directed topology and only the follower unmanned underwater vessels can read the states of the leader unmanned surface vessel. The proposed system consists of a guidance loop and a control loop. In the guidance loop, a novel cooperative guidance method between a surface and two underwater unmanned vessels is introduced by constructing a path deviation based on vertical line constructs. In the control loop, an iterative sliding mode controller is designed to mitigate chattering issues caused by switching system structures. Meanwhile, an optimization function is employed to optimize control inputs, addressing control input constraints, and reducing control input chattering. The external disturbances and unmodeled dynamics are estimated using a linear extended state observer, and the results are used for the controller design. Finally, simulation tests are carried out to validate the effectiveness of the proposed control system. © 2024 The Authors},

Two glass fibre-reinforced polymers, unidirectional and bi-axial stitched fabrics, are analysed. The study includes an experimental low-velocity impact of plates with solid objects, simulating low-velocity impact with floating debris, and an experimental bottom wave slamming test where the structure is dropped from a height of 1.5 m onto a calm water surface equivalent to an initial velocity of 5.43 (m/s). In addition, a destructive buckling test is carried out by applying pressure to the conical to assess the buckling strength of both laminates. Furthermore, the experimental buckling pressure failure is compared with the pressure peak determined by a numerical simulation, based on the Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian formulation, and with a design pressure suggested by a classification society recommended practice. Results demonstrate that the biaxial stitched fabric reveals a higher impact strength on both impacts with solids and fluids and a higher buckling strength. Moreover, the peak pressure determined by the numerical simulation is slightly higher than that a conservative design approach predicted. © 2024},

In order to make the modelling more flexible and physically more realistic, a modified version of Ahkowitl model was introduced. During the identification process, the model's structure is fixed and its parameters have been obtained using system identification. A global optimization algorithm has been used to search the optimum values and minimize the loss functions. In order to reduce the effect of noise in the variables, different loss functions considering the empirical errors and generalization performance have been defined and implemented in the system identification program.

	abstract = {A review presents the state-of-the-art path-following control systems for maritime autonomous surface ships, where the special focus is placed on the guidance subsystem and control subsystem. The path following control system is one of the basic requirements for autonomous ships since it guarantees that the ship can track the predefined path with small cross-track errors. The path following problem is firstly defined, and the cross-track error dynamics are derived from the kinematic equations of marine surface ships. The classical guidance laws are introduced, and the governing equations are also presented in this paper. A review of the guidance laws and controllers for the maritime autonomous surface ships has been carried out based on relevant journal and conference papers. Several important properties and characteristics, such as control structure, guidance law, control method, stability, environmental disturbance and vessel dynamics, are defined for the comparative analysis. Finally, the summary and a discussion on the most used technologies for the path following control of marine autonomous surface ships are presented and highlighted. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {In this paper, an adaptive nonlinear vessel steering model is proposed. A time-sequence Least square support vector machine (LS-SVM) based on incremental and decremental updating algorithm is proposed to estimate the parameters dynamically. The proposed method is different from the online estimations method based on a sliding data window, which usually needs to train the model when a new sample is observed during each time step. It usually indicates an expensive and time-costing operation for training SVM. In the presented method, the parameters can update in an incremental and decremental way, which avoid the training operation. The validation is carried out based on the manoeuvring tests using a free-running ship model. The obtained parameters agree well with the analytical values. The effect of the length of the training set is also discussed. The size of training set plays a trade-off on the stable and response speed of the system. The proposed method can dynamically estimate the parameters with a good accuracy and fast response. It can be used for designing a dynamic model-based control system for vehicles. © 2022 the Author(s).},

Truncated LS-SVM is shown to be an efficient and robust method that avoids the costly matrix inversion operation in classical LS-SVM using the singular values decomposition. Meanwhile, the smaller singular values are neglected considering their negligible contribution to the solutions. In order to get a robust parameter estimation, the model simplification of the nonlinear manoeuvring model is carried out using a leave-one-out method, considering the trade-off between the parameter uncertainty and accuracy of the numerical model. The simplified manoeuvring model and the values of nondimensionalized hydrodynamic coefficients are presented. The coefficients are estimated using Planar motion mechanism (PMM) tests, which were carried out in a towing tank. The validation process is carried to validate the generalization performance of the obtained numerical model using the PMM test data. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The variable displacement oil-hydraulic pumps for the Power Take-Off (PTO) of wave energy converters must work above 80% of maximum displacement in order to have an overall efficiency of approximately 94.5%. This is achieved by controlling their rotational speed when the oil-hydraulic power fluctuates in time. Three speed control strategies have been presented, the first fixing the maximum possible speed in each sea state, the second by slowly varying the pump speed between speed peak values and average ones, and the third by working with highly variable speed reference values. The worst pump efficiency is achieved with the first strategy while the best one with the third strategy. However, the first has less impact than the third one in the pump lifecycle. On the other hand, the second strategy is used to make a trade-off between pump efficiency and lifecycle. However, this paper presents a fourth speed control strategy, which is a hybrid of the second and third strategies. So, the objectives of this paper were to know if these strategies are implementable in a test rig and also on a new PTO concept and determining what modifications should be introduced in these PTO strategies and hardware.

However, environmental disturbances present significant challenges to the stability and precision of towing systems. This study presents a control approach integrating Adaptive Unscented Kalman Filtering (AUKF) with Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC). The proposed method enables two tugboats to collaboratively tow a ship along a desired trajectory while mitigating the effects of disturbances. The ship controller minimizes trajectory deviations while ensuring compliance with system constraints. To enhance robustness, the AUKF dynamically updates noise covariance matrices based on state covariance and observation errors, providing accurate state estimates for the ship controller, which then computes the desired positions for the tugboats. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method improves trajectory tracking accuracy and system robustness under disturbed conditions.  © 2025 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In the field of Autonomous Surface Vehicle (ASV), research on advanced perception technologies is crucial for enhancing their intelligence and autonomy. In particular, laser point cloud registration technology serves as a foundation for improving the navigation accuracy and environmental awareness of ASV in complex environments. To address the issues of low computational efficiency, insufficient robustness, and incompatibility with low-power devices in laser point cloud registration technology for ASV, a novel point cloud matching method has been proposed. The proposed method includes laser point cloud data processing, feature extraction based on an improved Fast Point Feature Histogram (FPFH), followed by a two-step registration process using SAC-IA (Sample Consensus Initial Alignment) and Small_GICP (Small Generalized Iterative Closest Point). Registration experiments conducted on the KITTI benchmark dataset and the Pohang Canal dataset demonstrate that the relative translation error (RTE) of the proposed method is 16.41 cm, which is comparable to the performance of current state-of-the-art point cloud registration algorithms. Furthermore, deployment experiments on multiple low-power computing devices showcase the performance of the proposed method under low computational capabilities, providing reference metrics for engineering applications in the field of autonomous navigation and perception research for ASV. © 2025 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The diesel fuel system is critical to the functioning of diesel engines, and its failure can result in significant economic losses and operational risks. This paper presents a fault diagnosis method that integrates wavelet analysis with a neural network for managing the health of diesel engine fuel systems. First, the oil pressure waveform of a diesel engine’s high-pressure oil pipe is collected using an external clamp-on pressure sensor. Wavelet threshold denoising is then applied to eliminate noise from the oil pressure signal. Next, characteristic parameters of the oil pressure waveform, such as waveform width, amplitude, and maximum pressure, are extracted, and wavelet packet band analysis is employed to decompose and analyse the signal. These extracted parameters serve as input vectors for a neural network. A combined self-organizing mapping back propagation (SOM-BP) neural network model is developed to diagnose fuel system faults. Experimental results demonstrate that this model significantly enhances diagnostic accuracy and can effectively identify various fault types.  © Beijing Paike Culture Commu. Co., Ltd. 2025.},

Two classical nonlinear manoeuvring models, generic and vectorial models, are briefly introduced, and the prime system of SNAME is chosen as the normalization forms for the hydrodynamic coefficients. The optimal truncated LS-SVM is introduced. It is a robust method for parameter estimation by neglecting the small singular values, which contribute negligibly to the solutions and increase the parameter uncertainty. The parameter with a large uncertainty is sensitive to the noise in the data and have a poor generalization performance. The classical LS-SVM and optimal truncated LS-SVM are used to estimate the parameters, and the effectiveness of optimal truncated LS-SVM is validated. The parameter uncertainty for both nonlinear manoeuvring models is discussed. The generalization performance of the obtained numerical models is further tested against the validation set, which is completely left untouched in the training. The R2 goodness-of-fit criterion is used to demonstrate the accuracy of the obtained models. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

In order to address the aforementioned issues, this paper proposes a path-following control strategy based on a virtual circle guidance method. Firstly, by constructing a virtual heading, the following of waypoints are transformed into the control of the virtual heading. A sliding mode controller is employed to control the heading of the underactuated unmanned surface vessel. To reduce overshooting during the following of waypoints, a variable virtual circle is constructed based on the angle between the connecting lines of waypoints. A linear extended state observer is designed to estimate external disturbances and unmodeled dynamics, and the estimated disturbances are compensated in the controller design to enhance the robustness of the system. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is validated using simulation tests. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Carlos Guedes Soares and Tiago A.

In order to obtain the hydrodynamic coefficients, system identification is used to estimate the parameters using Planar Motion Mechanism (PMM) test data. Usually, the obtained parameters using measured data have a large uncertainty due to the illconditioned processes of identification. An optimal Truncated Singular Value Decomposition (TSVD) method is exploited to reduce the uncertainty of the estimated parameters. The optimal number of retaining singular values is calculated by using the Lcurve, which is a log-log plot of the norm of a regularized solution versus the norm of the corresponding residual norm. It is a graphical tool for displaying the trade-off between the estimated parameters norm and the corresponding residual error norm. The validation process is performed by comparison of the prediction values with the experimental data in the time domain. Copyright © 2018 ASME.},

The series of free rolling decay test was carried out by changing the draft, the transverse distance of side hull and the inclination angle of side hulls. Considering of the special structure of composite trimaran and the complex flow field around the trimaran in the process of rolling, the author established the mathematical model of rolling motion. By identifying the composite trimaran rolling motion mode ,we got the curve of hydrodynamic coefficients by a reliable and efficient system identification software. The author analyzed the phenomenon of roll amplitudes mutation and got some conclusions.

An analytical formulation is used to compare and check the accuracy of the system identification method. Then, considering the uncertainty in estimated parameters, a sliding mode controller for the path following control is implemented with −20%,0%, and 20% uncertainty in the obtained coefficients, (K, T). To follow the desired path, the Dynamic Line of Sight algorithm is proposed and its parameters are obtained based on the optimal performance of the ASV in converging to the desired path. The results demonstrate that theε-SVR can adequately estimate the hydrodynamic coefficients using free-running model tests. Similarly, the designed controller also showed that ASV followed the predefined path with an average following error of 9.5%. The simulation results considering the bounded of 20% uncertainty in hydrodynamic parameters also show that the uncertainty effects are less on the path following control (average of −9.9% in −20% and 2.8% in +20% uncertainty) and not made instability in the designed controller. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {A new concept of an oil-hydraulic accumulator is proposed in this work to improve the harvesting performance of wave energy converters. The oil-hydraulic power take-off converts the reciprocating motion of the wave energy converter prime mover into the rotation of the generator shaft. Oil-hydraulic power take-offs integrated with accumulators are commonly classified as constant-pressure type. Conventional accumulators reduce the pressure fluctuation in the hydraulic systems but also impose limitations on the adaptability of the power take-offs to different sea states. This accumulator consists of two standard accumulators whose gas chambers are interconnected so that the charging characteristics of the accumulator can be adjusted by compressing or decompressing the gas in the shared chambers. Thus, compared to the conventional power take-offs, the power take-off integrated with the active accumulator system can be actively adapted to different sea states and ultimately improve the harvesting performance of the wave energy converter. The work focuses on the numerical implementation of the concept and the results indicate the accumulator concept brings significant advantages compared to the conventional in terms of better power output over a wide range of sea states. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Carlos Guedes Soares and Tiago A.

	abstract = {Experiments are conducted in a flume to study the mooring forces and motions of a gravity cage in regular waves. Cage models are built with hollow pipes and nets. Mooring forces and cage motions including surge, heave and pitch are measured. With the increase of the wavelength, the mooring force, surge and heave increase while the rate of increase gradually slows down until stops. On the other hand, under short waves, the pitch increases with the decrease of the wavelength. In addition, the cage does not finish a cycle of motion before the next peak arrives, which leads to a reduction in mooring forces and motion in all directions. With the observation of overtopping, it can be concluded that the motion of the cage goes through three phases with the growth of the wavelength. Under short waves, the cage does not have enough time to complete a cycle of motion and overtopping occurs. With the increase of the wavelength, the motion of the cage starts to follow the waves and overtopping disappears. When the wave is long enough, the cage is pulled into the water by the mooring line and overtopping occurs again. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {A modified path-following control system using the vector field method for an underactuated autonomous surface ship model is proposed in the presence of static obstacles. With this integrated system, autonomous ships are capable of following the predefined path, while avoiding the obstacles automatically. It is different from the methods in most published papers, which usually study path-following and obstacle collision avoidance, separately. This paper considers the coupled path following and collision avoidance task as a whole. Meanwhile, the paper also shows the heading control design method in the presence of static obstacles. To obtain a strong stability property, a nonlinear autopilot is designed based on the manoeuvring tests of the free-running ship model. The equilibrium point of the controller is globally exponentially stable. For the guidance system, a novel vector field method was proposed, and the proof shows the coupled guidance and control system is uniform semi-global exponentially stable (USGES). To prevent the obstacles near the predefined path, the proposed guidance law is augmented by integrating the repelling field of obstacles so that it can control the ship travel toward the predefined path through the obstacles safely. The repelling field function is given considering the obstacle shape and collision risk using the velocity obstacle (VO) algorithm. The simulations and ship model test were performed to validate the integrated system of autonomous ships. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {A uniform semiglobal exponential stability (USGES) proof for a time-varying vector field guidance law used for path-following control of vehicles is presented. A sliding mode control is introduced for heading autopilot design and Lyapunov methods are used to derive the control law. The equilibrium point of the autopilot error dynamics is proven to be globally exponentially stable (GES). The main result is a time-varying vector field guidance law in cascade with the autopilot. A theorem ensures that the equilibrium point of the cascaded system is uniformly semiglobally exponentially stable. Both straight-line and curved-path path following scenarios are considered in the presence of ocean currents. Simulation studies are carried out to verify the theoretical results. The time-varying guidance laws can also be applied to vehicles in general such as aircraft, underwater vehicles, drones and autonomous vehicles. © 2019 European Control Association},

	abstract = {This work investigates an innovative decentralized formation control method for underactuated surface vessel (USV) and underactuated aerial vehicles (UAVs) to achieve path following in the presence of external disturbances. The design of the USV-UAVs cooperative path following controller is divided mainly into two parts. The first part is the guidance system,which employs a line of sight (LOS) based on a switching mechanism for selecting the next way point to steer the USV in path following, thereby mitigating overshooting at turning points. For UAVs, the virtual attitude angles are designed to guide UAVs in tracking the USV's trajectory. The second part is the control system, which uses sliding mode to design a controller to enable the USV-UAVs to track the reference path. An extended state observer,the genetic algorithm-based extended state observer (GAESO), is proposed to estimate unmodeled dynamics and external disturbances. The stability proof of both the USVs and UAVs is presented using the Lyapunov theorem. Finally, the simulation tests are carried out to validate the proposed system and control methods in the presence of environmental disturbance. © 2025},

Compared to classical Sliding Mode Controller (SMC) and Adaptive Sliding Mode Controller (ASMC), the proposed system enables large ships to track the desired path much faster, meanwhile, the course stability can also be achieved with the controller saturation and environmental disturbance. To solve the problems of high nonlinearity and uncertainty of ship motion in restricted waters, the mathematical model with Extended state observer (ESO) is proposed to linearize problem. A drift angle observer is established to observe the drift angle during the vessel's navigation, and the LOS guidance law is used to achieve accurate tracking of the desired trajectory. The simulation results show that the inland ships under the control of the proposed scheme can accurately track the desired trajectory in a restricted waterway.

	abstract = {This paper explores the impact of sampling rates during sea trials on the estimation of hydrodynamic parameters in a nonlinear manoeuvring model. Sea trials were carried out using an offshore patrol vessel and test data were collected. A nonlinear manoeuvring model is introduced to characterise the ship’s manoeuvring motion, and the truncated least squares support vector machine is employed to estimate nondimensional hydrodynamic coefficients and their corresponding uncertainties using the 25°–25° zigzag test. To assess the influence of the sampling rates, the training set is resampled offline with 14 sampling rates, ranging from 0.2 Hz to 5 Hz, encompassing a rate 10 times the highest frequency component of the signal of interest. The results show that the higher sampling rate can significantly diminish the parameter uncertainty. To obtain a robust estimation of linear and nonlinear hydrodynamic coefficients, the sampling rate should be higher than 10 times the highest frequency component of the signal of interest, and 3–5 Hz is recommended for the case in this paper. The validation is also carried out, which indicates that the proposed truncated least square support vector machine can provide a robust parameter estimation. © 2024 by the authors.},

However, image and video stitching still encounter challenges, including large parallax, occlusion, weak texture, shape distortion, video jitter, and low efficiency. In recent years, these challenges have spurred the development of various new image and video stitching techniques. This work offers a comprehensive review of the latest advancements in image and video stitching techniques. First, we analyze traditional stitching methods and deep learning-based methods, discussing key techniques such as shape correction in image stitching and video stabilization. Second, we review datasets and evaluation metrics for image and video stitching tasks and analyze the performance of mainstream algorithms on representative datasets. Finally, we discuss typical application scenarios and future research directions for image and video stitching.

	abstract = {This paper proposes a hybrid dynamic path planning algorithm that integrates global path planning (GPP) and local path planning (LPP). The objective is to effectively address the challenges associated with path planning and collision avoidance for unmanned surface vehicles (USV) in complex environments. The bidirectional A* algorithm is used to search the optimized strategy based on the actual geographical information map for the navigation routes of USV. The Dynamic Window Algorithm (DWA) is employed, and a novel cost function is formulated considering the USV's manoeuvring characteristics, dynamic constraints, and environmental information. The primary purpose is to ensure the compliance of the USV with COLREGs during dynamic obstacle avoidance. It accomplishes this by providing positive reinforcement for achieving the correct turning speed when the USV determines the orientation of an approaching ship. Another evaluation function is introduced to mitigate the problem of local optima in complex environments that the LPP may encounter. The actual work map is used to model the application scenario with the obstacles in the presence of incoming ships, the simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is capable of generating adaptive, collision-free routes while adhering to COLREGs rules. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {The complex characteristics of ship motion under various manoeuvres and environmental conditions are determined online by a non-parametric identification model. This paper introduces a novel online ship motion modelling method that adaptively adjusts the training samples based on a sparse hybrid kernel relevance vector machine. Firstly, to fully capture the motion characteristics of the ship, the manoeuvrability test data is collected from a marine manoeuvring simulator, including different operators, engine orders, rudder angles and environments. Additionally, full-scale sea trial data is obtained from the YUKUN vessel, a ship type different from the virtual ship in the simulator. Subsequently, an adaptive criterion for updating the training sample is developed, and a sliding time window is applied to dynamically update the ship motion data. Finally, the motion states and trajectories of both ships are predicted under different conditions. These results show that the proposed method is well-suited for online non-parametric modelling of different ships and manoeuvre conditions. The proposed scheme's mean squared error and mean absolute error are below 0.10 and 0.16. Compared with the non-adaptive online scheme, the proposed approach has stronger generalisation and adaptability. This scheme can serve as a reference for online non-parametric modelling of unmanned surface vehicles. © 2025},

This work analyzes these demands on the drives and designs reliable control approaches for such drives by simulating a wave-to-wire model in a hardware in-the-loop simulation test rig. The model is based on a point absorber wave energy converter, being the wave, hydrodynamic and oil-hydraulic part simulated in a computer that sends and receives signals from the real embedded components, such as the drive generator, controller and back-to-back converter. Three different control strategies are developed and tested in this test rig and the results revealed that despite the drive limitations to acceleration levels, well above 1 × 104 rpm/s, these do not significantly affect the power take-off efficiency, because the required acceleration peaks rarely achieve these values. Moreover this drive is much more economical than an oil-hydraulic and equivalent one that is able to operate at those peaks of acceleration. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

This is performed in two ways: Using simulated data and free-running test data. The identification and validation with the simulation data are carried out using a 25 turning test and a 20-20 zigzag manoeuvring test. For the free-running test data, two zigzag manoeuvres are used: 30-30 zigzag for identification and 20-20 zigzag for validation. A nonlinear manoeuvring model is proposed based on the standard Euler equations, and the hydrodynamic coefficients are computed using empirical equations. To obtain robust results, the truncated singular value decomposition is employed to diminish the multicollinearity and the parameter uncertainties due to noise. The validation is carried out by comparing the result of the measured values with the predictions obtained using the manoeuvring models. Finally, a sensitivity analysis for the simulation data is performed to understand the influence of the parameters in the manoeuvres. © 2021 by the authors.},

	abstract = {For the Autonomous Maritime Navigation System, LiDAR 3D object detection is crucial for waterborne environment perception. However, complex dynamics and multi-scale objects, particularly small vessels, present significant accuracy challenges for current algorithms. To address these limitations, this study introduces point cloud intensity into the PointPillar detection network and proposes a novel 3D object detection method named Intensity-PointPillar. By incorporating average pooling and attention pooling into the encoding network, the method fully considers the local geometric details and point cloud intensity information within each pillar module, enhancing the feature representation capability of each pillar and thereby improving the model's object detection performance. Additionally, a multi-branch detection head is introduced, along with a point cloud intensity loss function, to mitigate the inconsistency between the object classification branch and the position regression branch. The proposed method is trained and evaluated using two real-world ship LiDAR point cloud datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the Intensity-PointPillar achieves significantly higher detection accuracy, with a mean Average Precision improvement of 31.6 % compared to the original network, thereby validating the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2025 The Authors.

	abstract = {To improve the accuracy and generalisation of the berthing perception system based on shipborne LiDAR, thereby enhancing the safety and operational efficiency of ship berthing, a berthing perception system based on laser point cloud data is proposed. This system consists of four components: laser point cloud data collection, three-dimensional ship target detection, boundary plane fitting of target berths, and berthing state estimation. The shipborne LiDAR captures three-dimensional environmental information around the vessel. By incorporating point cloud reflectivity into the encoding network, loss function, and ground truth label file of the PointPillar detection network, the accuracy of ship target detection is enhanced, and the point cloud of the detected vessel is extracted based on the location of the detection box. A plane model of the target vessel or berth boundary is extracted using the Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) algorithm, and the berthing state of the ship is calculated based on this plane model. The berthing perception system was validated in real-world experiments using an unmanned vessel (Zhilong NO.1) at Lingshui Port and a section of the Tianjin Haihe River, where the vessel was berthed alongside a moored ship and in available berth areas. Real-time positioning data from the Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) system is used to validate the accuracy of the proposed berth state estimation. The experimental results show that, compared to representative ship detection models, the mean Average Precision (mAP) of the proposed three-dimensional ship target detection method increased by 14.3 %. The root mean square error of the distance measurement in the berthing state estimation module was approximately 0.2514 m, which is an improvement of 0.1107 m over methods based on berth lines. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed berthing perception system can provide accurate berthing state estimates to assist operators in berthing operations. © 2025 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Given the limitations of single data-driven models and single-step prediction schemes, this paper proposes a multi-step online motion prediction scheme based on the weighted multi-kernel relevance vector machine, pre-training strategy, and ensemble learning framework. To evaluate the effectiveness and generalisation of the proposed scheme, four degrees of freedom motion data are collected under various wind conditions. A subset of motion data is used as training samples to pre-train three sub-models, whose parameters are tuned using an improved grey wolf optimiser algorithm. To integrate the prediction results of the sub-models, this paper develops an ensemble learning framework and proposes an adaptive weight updating rule. Then, this paper conducts single-step, 5-step, and 10-step time series predictions of ship motion. The comparison results with long short-term memory method confirm the adaptability and generalisation of the proposed scheme. The final experimental results show that the proposed scheme maintains good generalisation and time efficiency while ensuring low model complexity. The mean squared errors of the single-step and multi-step prediction results are below 8×10−3 and 0.28.

Radial basis function-based neural networks (RBF-NNs) are used to estimate disturbances, and a high-order differentiator is used to design a velocity observer for unknown USV velocity. The UAV control system employs proportional–derivative (PD) control with feedforward compensation for quadrotor control design and utilizes a finite-time converging third-order differentiator to differentiate non-continuous functions.

	abstract = {This paper introduces an effective method with a regularization filter function and conducts stability and convergence analysis for the estimation of the hydrodynamic coefficients of a manoeuvring model. The proposed method is used to estimate the adjustment coefficients of empirical manoeuvring models using free-running manoeuvring ship model tests. The method avoids the recurrent difficulty that parameter estimation based on test data are usually ill-conditioned, and the obtained parameters are unstable and sensitive to noise. The model tests are carried out using a free-running scaled container ship, and the data acquisition and control system is implemented in the LabVIEW platform. Then, the obtained data are used for the parameter estimation using the proposed method and the optimal regularization factor is discussed. Validation is carried out and shows the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {A nonparametric identification method based on ν(‘nu’)-support vector regression (ν-SVR) is proposed to establish robust models of ship maneuvering motion in an easy-to-operate way. Assisted by the kernel trick, the nonlinear model learns implicitly in high-dimensional feature space without a priori model structure. The ν-SVR controls the sparsity automatically, resulting in high efficiency. To improve the practicality, a parameter tuning scheme combining the hold-out validation and the simulation of dynamic processes is designed to avoid overfitting. Taking the KVLCC2 ship as the study object, the experimental data from the SIMMAN database are used to evaluate the method. The selection and pre-processing of training data are discussed. The identified model shows good generalization performance in the prediction of multiple maneuvers not involved in the training set, verifying the effectiveness of the method. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

The motion planning algorithm is based in the angle-guidance fast marching square method and the guidance system is based in the line-of-sight trajectory tracking algorithm. To validate the motion planning algorithm, numerical simulations were carried out to compute the optimal path in a static environment including various obstacles. The guidance system was tested with an autonomous surface vehicle tracking a pre-established trajectory including static obstacles. The autonomous surface vehicle is a self-propelled scaled ship model of 2.5 m equipped with sensors and actuators, inertial measurement unit, GNSS positioning system, propulsion DC motors, and wireless communication. From the experiments and numerical simulations, a good agreement was found. Copyright © 2018 ASME.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates the formation control problem of underactuated unmanned surface vehicles with unknown dynamics and ocean disturbances. To tackle the leader-follower configuration, an improved fixed-time velocity controller is proposed for the virtual vehicle to guide the followers efficiently. For the tracking control of the follower vehicles, a concise controller is designed by borrowing on backstepping and nonsingular sliding mode control techniques. A novel adaptive filter is developed to address the so called “explosion of complexity” problem in the traditional backstepping framework, which could simplify the control structure and facilitate the implementation of the proposed controller in practical engineering. Furthermore, the radial basis function neural network is employed to identify the unknown dynamics of the vehicle model. A bounded-feedback adaptive law is developed to estimate the upper bound of the ocean disturbances. That could greatly enhance the robustness and accuracy of the controller. Finally, a rigorous proof has been given to guarantee the practical fixed-time stability of the closed-loop system. Two examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the theoretical results. © 2023},
