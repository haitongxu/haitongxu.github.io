This project proposes the creation of an integrated tool made of several numerical models able to characterize the wave climate and its effects in ports, particularly in terms of movements of ships moored to the pier. The validation of this tool will be done using physical model tests to be carried out under the scope of the project and in situ measurements in a Portuguese port. The information obtained from this tool will increase the competitiveness of our ports.
