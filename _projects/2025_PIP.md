## Abstract

This project proposes the development and integration of a low-cost autonomous surface vessel (ASV) model as a central teaching tool for the new curricular unit “Autonomous Marine Vehicles,” to be launched at IST in the upcoming academic year. The ASV model will serve as both a pedagogical and hands-on experimental platform that supports active learning strategies and interdisciplinary collaboration.
