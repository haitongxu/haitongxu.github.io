The aim of the OBSERVA.FISH is to develop a totally autonomous system (no human action), integrating several new parameters (meteorological and oceanographic), to install onboard of all types of fishing vessels (trawlers, purse-seiners, longliners). This observation system should allow high-resolution in situ monitoring and spatial coverage of the ocean and coastal areas.
