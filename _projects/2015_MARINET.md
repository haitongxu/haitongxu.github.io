The objective is to develop a PTO concept that works for a specific range of sea conditions. This PTO concept has to be developed in order to be generic enough to interface with different WECs, and then, maximize its implementation on technical and economic terms, because each PTO concept is currently developed for a particular WEC. The objective is to develop a generic, modular and scalable PTO concept that can be adapted to different types of WEC with reliable and standardized technology, and at the same solving the mentioned technical problems.
