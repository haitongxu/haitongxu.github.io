The project aims at development and testing of fast combined mathematical models for seakeeping and manoeuvring in waves and strong wind capturing all major nonlinear effects but suitable to be run in real or accelerated time on desktop or full-mission virtual reality manoeuvring simulators. The fast mathematical models will be developed as a fusion of recognized empiric calm-water manoeuvring models with parameters adjusted with and a specially developed semi-linear potential flow seakeeping model based on preliminary studies earlier performed by the proponents. The model will account for both first- and second-order excitation forces and will be uniformly valid for arbitrary values of the encounter frequency. The complete model will be merged with the desktop virtual-reality interactive simulator similar to one earlier developed by the proponents for another purposes.
